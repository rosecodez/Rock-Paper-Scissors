Simple Rock Paper Scissors game where user inputs his choice in the prompt, playing against the computer 5 rounds.

    This was my first project that I have done with no prior experience in programming. After learning the first fundamentals in JavaScript (variable, function, if/else statements ) I made this project. I had to search on how call a function multiple times since it was not included in the previous lessons. I also had trouble understanding how the data is stored within the program vs. the return and the solution was that i should have use more the console.log to have more of a visual side of things.  Another thing I had trouble with was the stack order of the functions (calling some functions before more important functions, that stored data needed for the first function).
    I have learned that the function is basically one of the most important pieces to use in JS code and this proved it. It's really easy to create function for needed action and then just call whenever needed!

How the game works:
- user inputs a value between rock/paper/scissors through a prompt;
- computer returns a value based on randomization;
- the rounds are repeating 5 times;
- after each round the console will display the winner for each round through comparison;
- at the end there are displayed all the points and the final winner;
